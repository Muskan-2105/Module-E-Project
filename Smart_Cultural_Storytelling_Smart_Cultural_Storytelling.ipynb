The system is designed to make cultural education more appealing to younger audiences who prefer short videos and interactive content.\n\nThe project has two modes:\n- **Mode 1:** Cultural Story Generator (AI-generated videos)\n- **Mode 2:** “What If?” Interactive Storytelling (choice-based narratives)\n\nThe focus of this project is not on training AI models, but on designing a complete AI-driven system using existing generative tools responsibly.",

Problem Statement\n\nMany cultural stories, myths, and festival origins are still shared through books or static content, which often fails to engage Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha audiences. At the same time, these generations actively consume reels, short videos, and interactive media.\n\nThis project addresses this gap by using AI to transform cultural stories into engaging audio-visual narratives while keeping the content respectful and educational.",
